## Project Description

Period 5
Nicolas Marchese, Sandra Gao
Slice and Dice

We're recreating the popular mobile puzzle game Cut the Rope.
The goal of the game is to deliver a suspended piece of candy by cutting the ropes that hold the candy up.
Lots of physics and strategy aspects are involved in each level.
There are also collectible stars and items that make a level easier!
Overall, our game is simple, nice to look at, and fun to play.
