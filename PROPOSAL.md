# IDEAS:

## 1. Cut the Rope

We will code a recreation of various levels in the physics-puzzle mobile game Cut the Rope.
Nearly all aspects of the game will be recreated, like gravity, rope behavior, and swipe detection, in our edition on Processing.
All this will be combined with original sprites in order to make our recreation as accurate as possible.

## 2. Chess

We will code a playable chess game in Processing, where one can either play with another person or with a bot who makes random moves.
All normal chess rules will apply and the game will not be simplified in any way.
2-dimensional graphics with sprites will be implemented for the best player experience; we will make it easy to play and input moves.

## 3. Super Mario Bros.

We will code a recreation of the classic platformer Super Mario Bros.
All the normal aspects of the game will be implemented in our remake, i.e. gravity, item collection, and jumping.
The controls will remain similar to the original game and lives, score, and coins will also be collectables.
