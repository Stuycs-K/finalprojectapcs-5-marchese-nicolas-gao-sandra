### 2025-05-23 - set up skeleton
spend class period (41min) setting up methods according to uml diagram.

### 2025-05-26 - starting up game mechanics
spent ~45min finishing setting up methods + started isCut()

### 2025-05-27 - object displays
spent class period (41min) + 90min adding constructors, display methods

### 2025-05-28 - Rope and Candy classes
spent class period (41min) adding new methods where needed

### 2025-05-29 - revising uml
spent class period (41min) adding fields overlooked in planning process

### 2025-05-30 - gravity
spent class period (41min) + 30min trying to get gravity into rope mechanics

### 2025-06-01 - Rope.stretch()
spent 2hrs trying debug rope motion

### 2025-06-02 - Rope.stretch() fixed + other basic mechanics
spent 1hr debugged rope motion, added rudimentary win / lose indicators, cutting motion

### 2025-06-03 - attempting fix ropes in class
spent class period (41min) trying to fix ropes; did not reach any better state than started with

### 2025-06-04 - more ropes + fields
spent class period (41min) testing out constants for ropes + keeping ropes constant length + onRope field to track when only gravity applies

### 2025-06-06 - adjusting force calculations
spent class period (41min) adjusting force calculations to only have gravity when rope is not at max and cancel gravity when rope reaches max

# 2025-06-08 - adjusting pendulum motion + sprites
spent 30min adjusting calculations to get more swinging motion
spent 1hr adding character support sprites (ledges) + displaying them

I believe this document accurately reflects the contributions of my teammate.
